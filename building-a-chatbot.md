- **Definition**: A chatbot is an AI-driven program designed to simulate human conversation.
- **Types**: Rule-based chatbots and AI chatbots (machine learning-based).

### What is NLP?

- **Definition**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.
- **Components**:
  - Tokenization
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## 2. Step-by-Step Explanation of Building a Chatbot

### Step 1: Define the Purpose

- **Identify the goal**: What do you want the chatbot to do?
- **Target audience**: Who will be using the chatbot?

### Step 2: Choose the Right Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: 
  - **Bot Frameworks**: Botpress, Rasa, Microsoft Bot Framework
  - **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers

### Step 3: Design the Conversation Flow

- **Dialogue design**: Create a flowchart mapping user inputs to bot responses.
- **Intent recognition**: Define intents (user goals) and corresponding responses.

### Step 4: Develop and Train the Model

- **Data Collection**: Gather conversational data.
- **Model Training**: Use NLP libraries to train the chatbot.

```python
# Example: Simple chatbot using NLTK
import nltk
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections

# Define pairs of patterns and responses
pairs = [
    ["hello", ["Hi there!"]],
    ["how are you", ["I'm a chatbot, I'm always good!"]]
]

# Create a Chat object
chatbot = Chat(pairs, reflections)

# Start the conversation
chatbot.converse()
```

### Step 5: Test and Deploy

- **Testing**: Evaluate the chatbot's performance in different scenarios.
- **Deployment**: Integrate the chatbot into a platform (website, app, etc.).
