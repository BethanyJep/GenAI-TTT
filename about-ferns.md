# Prompt Engineering Techniques in the Microsoft Copilot

Here’s how we can use Microsoft Copilot to create a course outline and materials for a lesson on ferns, combining **text** and **images** with prompts designed for both

## Fern Lesson Course Outline  

### **Topic**: The World of Ferns – Understanding Non-Flowering Plants  

### **Objectives**:  
1. Define what ferns are and explain their biological classification.  
2. Describe the life cycle of a fern with a focus on alternation of generations.  
3. Identify key types of ferns and their ecological significance.  
4. Discuss how ferns adapt to different environments and their uses in daily life.  

### **Course Materials**:  
1. **Lesson Text Content**: Generated using Microsoft Copilot prompts.  
2. **Illustrative Images**: Generated using AI Image Creator with detailed prompts.  
3. **Output Format**: Combined text and images formatted in Markdown for use in presentations or online learning portals.

### Prompts to Generate Content  

#### **Step 1: Generating Lesson Content (Text)**  

**Prompt**:  
```
Create a detailed, engaging lesson on ferns for a one-hour training module.  
Include:  
1. An introduction to ferns (definition and classification).  
2. A step-by-step explanation of the life cycle of a fern (alternation of generations).  
3. Examples of fern species with brief descriptions (e.g., Boston Fern, Staghorn Fern).  
4. A discussion on ferns’ ecological role and practical uses.  
5. Key takeaways as a summary.  

Output the content in Markdown format, organized into sections with headings.  
```

#### **Step 2: Generating Illustrative Images (Creative Mode)**  

**Prompt Examples**:  
1. **For Fern Biology**:  
   ```
   Create an image of a lush green fern plant with labeled parts: fronds, rhizome, and sori.  
   ```  

![](./media/a%20lush%20green%20fern%20plant%20with%20labeled%20parts_%20fronds,%20rhizome,%20and%20sori.png)

2. **For Life Cycle**:  
   ```
   Generate a detailed diagram of the life cycle of a fern, showing both the gametophyte and sporophyte stages, including spore dispersal and fertilization.  
   ```  

![](./media/detailed%20diagram%20of%20the%20life%20cycle%20of%20a%20fern,%20showing%20both%20the%20gametophyte%20and%20sporophyte%20stages,%20including%20spore%20dispersal%20and%20fertilization.png)

3. **For Ecological Role**:  
   ```
   Create an image showing a tropical rainforest with various fern species thriving under the canopy, illustrating their ecological niche.  
   ```  

![](./media/a%20tropical%20rainforest%20with%20various%20fern%20species%20thriving%20under%20the%20canopy,%20illustrating%20their%20ecological%20niche.png)

4. **For Practical Uses**:  
   ```
   Generate an image of a living room decorated with potted Boston Ferns, highlighting their use as air purifiers.  
   ```  
![](./media/a%20living%20room%20decorated%20with%20potted%20Boston%20Ferns,%20highlighting%20their%20use%20as%20air%20purifiers.png)

### **Combining Text and Images**  

After generating text and images:  

1. Evaluate the generated content:  
   - Ensure biological accuracy of definitions and diagrams.  
   - Review ecological relevance and real-world applications.  
   - Check for societal biases and ensure inclusivity in examples and imagery.  

2. Combine content into a cohesive lesson:  
   - Use headings to structure information clearly.  
   - Place each AI-generated image alongside the corresponding text.

# The World of Ferns – Understanding Non-Flowering Plants  

## Introduction to Ferns  
Ferns are non-flowering vascular plants classified under the Pteridophyta division. They reproduce via spores instead of seeds and thrive in diverse environments.  

## Life Cycle of a Fern  
![Fern Life Cycle Diagram](fern_life_cycle.png)  
Ferns exhibit alternation of generations, switching between the gametophyte and sporophyte stages...  

## Key Types of Ferns  
- **Boston Fern**: Popular indoor plant known for its feathery fronds.  
- **Staghorn Fern**: Epiphytic fern resembling antlers, often mounted on walls.  

## Ecological Role  
Ferns are integral to ecosystems, aiding in soil stabilization and providing habitat for small animals.
